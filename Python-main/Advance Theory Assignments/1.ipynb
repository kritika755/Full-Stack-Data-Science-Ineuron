    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except for the functions which are within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason we may say is, increasing the implementation,modularbility, using encapsulation technqiues, etc.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans. Actually both are same somehow. The object is something which we can feel or it is real world entity but Instance is a virtual copy of an object. We cannot see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, when we define a class and assign some variable like 'obj_name=class_name()', this will create an instance of a class which is refering to the class actually. When we refer some object which has some property and characteristics, we can say that it is an instance of a particular class. Example, iphone is an object and we call it because apple name dit. So it is an object. But in the same time it is also an smartphone. It belong to some smartphone class. So we now refer it an instance of a smartphone class.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we create a variable like 'var_name=10', here 'var_name' is a object for integer 10. So 'instance' is nothing but something which represents the class and a virtual copy of an object"
