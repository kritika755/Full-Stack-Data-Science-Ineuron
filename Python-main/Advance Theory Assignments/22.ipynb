    "In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number.\n",

    "\n",
    "The array package doesn't provide any help with numerical calculation with the items insdie it in number form while NumPy give you a wide variety of numerical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a single dimensional entity which hold the numerical data, while numpy can have more than 1 dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of array, item can be accessed by its index position and it is easy task while in numpy item is accessed by its column and row index, which makes it slightly time taking. Same goes with appending operation.\n",

    "Ans.\n",

    "empty function: An empty function is a function that does not contain any statement within its body. If you try to write a function definition without any statement in python ,it will return an error. To avoid this, we use pass statement. pass is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement\n",

    "ones: This function returns a new array of given shape and data type, where the element’s value is 1.\n",

    "Its function is to execute the function over each coordinate and the resulting array. The function is called with N parameters, where N is the rank of shape. Each parameter represents the coordinates of the array varying along a specific axis.\n",
