But it may happen that someone other than us can also be use the same attributes with similar name from outside or inside the class. So in that case there will be change in our program codes. This will change the entire meaning of that code. So in order to make it safe from other users we use double underscore ( ) as a notation for private attribues or methods So that others cannot use it and if they able to use it then they cannot be able to access it."
