    "String based exceptions are the messages which we give by ourself so that when error occurs then instead of original exception error message, we get that message which we have written in the string form. But this has some drawback. Suppose an error occured and we wanted to know that which kind or type of error it is, there it failed because we have given the customised error message.\n",
