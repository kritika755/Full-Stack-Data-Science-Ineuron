    "\n",
    "Ans. This is because as a good programmer its our responsibility that we should create a logger instead of printing information it into console so that user do not get frustated after seeing so many error/messages and data in console amd this will also helpful because with logging we are storing the information in some file so that we can check the code flow even line by line. So it should be our practice that it we should capture the data into a log file so that whenever system gets crashed we can easliy able to see that log file rather than seeing in console which is something irritating and not a good practice. It can also be helpfull when some unwanted user uses the code, then we can easily able to get the line by line information."
